[EXPLANATION]
The speaker is explaining the <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">knowledge discovery process</span>, which involves several steps. The process starts with databases, where raw data is stored. This data is then cleaned and integrated, often into a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">data warehouse</span>. From the data warehouse, relevant data is selected for further analysis. The core of the process is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">data mining</span>, where patterns are discovered within the selected data. Finally, these patterns are evaluated to assess their usefulness and validity. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The speaker emphasizes that this entire process is crucial for extracting valuable knowledge from data.</span>

[SEGMENT TRANSCRIPT]
[SEGMENT 00:01]
Okay. So we know about the data mining and what application they could be important. Let&#x27;s try talking about the process. We call them knowledge discovery process.

[SEGMENT 00:13]
So what are the knowledge of wisdom right here?

[SEGMENT 00:18]
Originally, data come from the database.

[SEGMENT 00:27]
So we actually also have the data warehouse.

[SEGMENT 00:30]
So the data warehouse is a term people don&#x27;t know that a lot, but like 20 years ago, it&#x27;s a very important concept.

[SEGMENT 00:45]
So after you clean and integrate, you got a lot of data.

[SEGMENT 00:48]
The data actually stored in data warehouse.

[SEGMENT 00:51]
So the data warehouse is a term people don&#x27;t know that a lot, but like 20 years ago, it&#x27;s a very important concept.

[SEGMENT 00:57]
And in certain country, there&#x27;s also important concept still then.

[SEGMENT 01:04]
And afterward, you select how the data.

[SEGMENT 01:07]
So we call them selection.

[SEGMENT 01:09]
And then sending to something we call the pattern.

[SEGMENT 01:13]
And we go through the data mining process.

[SEGMENT 01:17]
In order for us to go through this data mining process, then we need to evaluate as our good enough.

[SEGMENT 01:36]
That is this process.
