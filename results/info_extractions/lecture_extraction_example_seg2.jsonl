The process starts with databases, where raw data is stored. This data is then cleaned and integrated, often into a data warehouse. From the data warehouse, relevant data is selected for further analysis. The core of the process is data mining, where patterns are discovered within the selected data. Finally, these patterns are evaluated to assess their usefulness and validity. The speaker emphasizes that this entire process is crucial for extracting valuable knowledge from data.\n\n[SEGMENT TRANSCRIPT]\n[SEGMENT 00:01]\nOkay.
