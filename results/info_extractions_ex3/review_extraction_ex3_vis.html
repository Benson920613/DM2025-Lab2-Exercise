Review: &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot; is more History than Story  
Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s second Dune movie isn&#x27;t a sequel, not quite. As the full title implies, 
it&#x27;s part two of one madman&#x27;s attempt at transcribing Frank Herbert&#x27;s seminal space 
opera on the big screen. And so, it starts almost at the exact point the 2021 film ended, 
with Timothée Chalamet&#x27;s Paul Atreides seeking refuge among the Fremen after his Great 
House was dilacerated in a violent coup. The body of Jamis, the man Paul killed in ritual 
duel, is still fresh and carried by Stilgar&#x27;s tribesmen as they guide the princeling and his 
mother, Lady Jessica, to the underground warren of Sietch Tabr. A prophecy is at stake, 
and enemy troops aren&#x27;t nearly as deadly as the dangers waiting for them in the planet-
sized desert. 
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Dread is everywhere, overwhelming, sticking in the throat until it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">feels like you&#x27;re already 
being suffocated by the film before its epic imagery can get a chance to crush you</span>.</span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Villeneuve has done it again…</span> 
Prior to finding Paul in his desert odyssey, a black screen serves as the viewer&#x27;s entry 
point into Dune: Part Two. Over the void, a guttural cry articulates what seem like words, 
undecipherable if not for the subtitles stating: &quot;Power over Spice is power over all.&quot; That 
resource can only be found and harvested in Arrakis, a planet plagued and blessed by 
giant sandworms. A plague because they are leviathans swimming through a dry ocean, 
sowing death whenever they surface. Their preservation is also why the potential 
greenery of this world had to be suppressed until the planet remained as one massive 
expanse of sand with little to no water in sight.  
And the paramount need to keep them thriving comes from their blessing – the spice 
known as melange. It prolongs life and provides visions of past, sometimes future too. 
More importantly, it&#x27;s the basis of space travel in a world where computerized technology 
disappeared ages ago. It&#x27;s a lot, and so are the books that birthed these concepts. 
Published between 1963 and 1985, the six main Dune novels are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a critique of fascism 
written for an age of crumbling empires</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Anti-colonial sentiment meshes with fear for the 
ecological apocalypse that&#x27;s coming for the human race</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all wrapped up in a space opera 
left delirious by a spice overdose</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It&#x27;s political, and it&#x27;s nasty, including a vicious 
reckoning with the evil of any and all religions.</span> 
This last facet is evident all over Part Two, starting when Paul and Lady Jessica finally 
reach Stiech Tabr. There, they find a populus split by belief and skepticism, with Stilgar 
as their defender and the face of the zealot faction. To the tribe leader Javier Bardem 
plays with equal parts levity and despair, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the Atreides heir is the prophesized outsider 
that will guide the Fremen to Paradise</span> – the Lisan al Gaib or Kwisatz Haderach.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Zendaya&#x27;s Chani, who haunted Paul&#x27;s dreams in Part One, is less easy to convince</span>, though 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there&#x27;s a clear attraction between her and the young man</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the seedling of attention bound 
to blossom in barren land</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lady Jessica, for her part, must fulfill the role of the hero&#x27;s progenitor</span>, becoming a 
Reverend Mother by drinking the Water of Life. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It&#x27;s poison, but what choice does she 
have?</span> It&#x27;s either this or death. As part of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, she&#x27;s capable of 
transmutation, abating the toxicant&#x27;s deadly power within her. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It keeps Jessica from 
succumbing but also lets her inherit all memories of her female ancestors, centuries of 
pain and sorrow.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Change is unavoidable, and the film&#x27;s tone seizes in transformation with 
her.</span> In some ways, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lady Jessica was the beating heart of Part One</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">embodied by MVP 
Rebecca Ferguson as an internal storm of duty and defiance, always terrified of the 
machinations most others ignore.</span> 
Her choice of giving Duke Leto <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a</span> son was the fracture point in the centuries-old plan by 
which the Bene Gesserit constructed the Kwisatz Haderach belief and engineered a 
messiah they&#x27;d have complete control over. It&#x27;s all <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Machiavellian stratagem by power 
brokers using religion as their ultimate weapon</span>. Now, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lady Jessica becomes the picture&#x27;s 
creepiest fixture</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">her ascension to Reverend Mother like a severing of personhood</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">She 
becomes alienated and alienating</span>. Instead of contradicting her sisterhood&#x27;s grand plan, 
she <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">takes full advantage of the witches&#x27; doings</span>, spurring the faithful Fremen and pushing 
Paul down the path to absolute power. 
Through Ferguson&#x27;s work, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a vein of horror flows within Dune&#x27;s organism</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">intensified by 
her silent conversations with the fetus gestating inside</span>, a daughter not yet born but 
already burdened with the knowledge of generations. Unlike David Lynch, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Villeneuve 
isn&#x27;t brave enough to have that child see the light of day yet</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Alia is a voice and a vision in 
prophetic dreams, never a blue-eyed babe speaking with impossible wisdom</span>. Because of 
that and other <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">divergences from the novel&#x27;s Byzantine grotesquerie</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it doesn&#x27;t surprise me 
that Villeneuve intends to stop at Dune: Messiah, the second installment</span>. 
After all, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the sight of Paul&#x27;s future son in full glory seems antithetical to his brutalist 
cinema</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">If he couldn&#x27;t give us Alia or the spiced-out navigators, a human body merged 
with the Shai-Hulud would be unthinkable</span>. And what of the horde of Duncan Idaho 
clones or a universe regressed to the Middle Ages? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">One can practically picture the 
director gasping &quot;abomination&quot; to himself</span>. That may mean <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">his dramaturgic and aesthetic 
approach is a trap</span>. While it works for now, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the films&#x27; continuation into Children of 
Dune, The God Emperor, Heretics and so forth seems impossible</span>. At some point, there 
must be a metamorphosis of cinematic idiom, for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this vision of Dune cannot sustain itself 
or Herbert&#x27;s crazed text</span>.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Still, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it works marvelously in Part Two</span>, suggesting <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a space opera opulence the likes of 
which we&#x27;ve hardly seen on the big screen</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Villeneuve has a sense of scale like few 
directors nowadays</span>, all the more apparent in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a second chapter that need not be ruled by 
info dumps every few minutes</span>. With world-building behind them, the Part 
Two <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">filmmakers are ready to exist in the world without the need to explain it constantly</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It can be confusing and distancing, but that&#x27;s part of the charm</span>. The development lets the 
text flow through action more smoothly, but it also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">opens the floodgates for visual 
invention, much greater than what we saw in the first Dune</span>.  
In Part One, the different planets were united by ensconcing shadows, varied but 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">submitted to a sometimes-smothering aesthetic unity</span>. Sure, we glimpsed the Harkonnen 
obsidian throne and the Atreides&#x27; home planet of emerald hills and turquoise sea, but 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">their visual quality wasn&#x27;t a shocking contrast</span>. In this new film, after the desert-set first 
act gives way to a broader scope, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">every location and culture is a zap out of stylistic 
stagnation</span>. In Giedi Prime, where we meet Austin Butler&#x27;s psychopathic Feyd-Rautha and 
Léa Seydoux&#x27;s Lady Margot, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">daylight turns the image black-and-white</span>. It&#x27;s no standard 
grayscale, mind you. 
DP Greig Fraser has devised a look where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">white skin becomes alabaster lit from within</span>, 
and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gaping mouths are like oil pits crying a bloodthirsty howl</span>. Later in the same 
sequence, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Seydoux embodies a femme fatale floating through editing jumps and playful 
lighting, a dominatrix nun draped in velvet, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">ready to hypnotize her target and the 
audience watching in the movie theater</span></span>. We find another stylistic antithesis as we cut 
from there to the Imperial Court. Despite his penchant for epic imagery, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Villeneuve&#x27;s 
conception of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of the Known Universe and his 
dominion are conspicuously modest</span>. 
In a world full of gigantic structures, lifeless expanses, and seas of clamoring people, the 
ruling class inhabits <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a bubble of greenery and peace</span>. Maybe <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the quiet is a privilege almost 
rarer than spice</span>. It&#x27;s enough to bolster the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">striking (mis)casting of Christopher Walken 
and Florence Pugh</span> as the despot and his daughter, Princess Irulan. Even something as 
simple as the pops of melange blue on Arrakis have been <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">taken to new heights by CGI, 
production and costume design</span>. Going beyond what the eye can perceive, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the musicality 
of Part Two is equally astounding</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Hans Zimmer&#x27;s new main theme is something of a 
leitmotiv for the love between Paul and Chani</span>. 
I&#x27;d go so far as saying that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it conveys the emotional weight of Dune more than anything in 
the screenplay does</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">making amorphous chanting into a song of hope rather than the first 
film&#x27;s lamentation</span>. It&#x27;s also the wail of the Fremen faith, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a sacred sound that elevates the 
score to celestial heights</span> and brings the rest of the movie along for the ride. Which is why,
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 4**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
when the roar of battle takes over the sountrack, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="60" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the contrast is so visceral and upsetting</span> 
– <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="61" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">quite the rarity in this emotionally detached picture</span>. You see, much of Paul&#x27;s tragedy 
centers on the eradication of self, one’s own Humanity left behind. 
Led to drinking the Water of Life like his mother, he&#x27;s unmoored and made a tyrant at the 
head of a holy war. He&#x27;s left left cognizant of all that&#x27;s been and prescient of all that can 
be. However, the film presents this drama so that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="62" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we never truly feel the loss of Paul, the 
person</span>. In this and other ways, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="63" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Dune: Part Two fails as a story of characters</span>. But that&#x27;s 
because a story it is not. Instead, it&#x27;s a history, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="64" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">its characters naught but specks of dust 
carried by the winds of time</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="65" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">We don&#x27;t get to feel the intimate cost of choice because they 
seldom manifest in such terms</span>. One feels that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="66" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">everything has already happened, every 
path set in stone by a fatalistic chisel</span>. Instead of narrative, Dune has been <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="67" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">rendered a 
great mural carved into mausoleum walls</span>. It&#x27;s as if <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="68" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Villeneuve allies his perspective to the 
Bene Gesserit and their perusal of the bigger picture above all else</span>.  
For those hoping to engage with the characters&#x27; humanity, Dune: Part Two <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="69" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">may prove to 
be a frustrating watch</span>. But if you engage with what it&#x27;s offering, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="70" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it can be rewarding</span>. I 
confess it was something I struggled with in Part One but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="71" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">came to love</span> about its 
continuation, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="72" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all puzzle pieces slotted into place</span>. Even <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="73" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the relative anticlimax comes off as 
a fitting gesture</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="74" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There&#x27;s no triumph at the end of Dune: Part Two, for this is a hollow 
glory and should be treated accordingly</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="75" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It&#x27;s a pyrrhic victory</span> whether the figures on 
screen know it or not. Well, Paul knows it. Chani <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="76" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fears and hates it, trembling in fury</span> at 
everything to do with it. And Lady Jessica is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="77" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">reaching toward awareness, inching ever 
closer to knowledge and away from Humanity</span>. Everyone else <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="78" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">stays ignorant, blessedly 
drunk on what looks like narrative closure but isn&#x27;t</span>. Dune: Messiah awaits!
